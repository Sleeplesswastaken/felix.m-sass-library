        <h2> Australien </h2>
        <h3> Hexcode: #CC9911 </h3><br>
          <p>Australien is such an obscure color that it doesn't even have a Wikipedia article. In fact, 
            if you search for “Australien” online, you're more likely to find hits about Australia. 
            That's because “Australien” is actually the German name for Australia.<br><br>

            As for the color, the 1897 fashion guide House Decoration gave the hue its name. 
            The guide stated that the colors of the Outback inspired the name. The Outback, as you may know, is the large desert 
            that makes up much of Australia's territory. Like many deserts, the Outback has a brownish hue. However, the Outback's 
            brown is also somewhat reddish. <br><br>
            
            According to the aforementioned guide, the color was apparently quite popular in Victorian England. 
            Many women's dresses had the color.

        <h2> Burlywood </h2>
        <h3> Hexcode: #DEB8877 </h3><br>
          <p>Burlywood is one of those rare colors that have an exotic origin. 
            It's a shade of brown that gets its name from a tree native to India. 
            In particular, the hue refers to the shade of brown seen in wood made from that tree. 
            The tree in question, Butea frondosa, can also be found in the rest of South and Southeast Asia.

      <h2> Drake's Neck </h2>
      <h3> Hexcode: #08B07C</h3><br>
        <p>Drake's-Neck is a pretty interesting name for a shade of blue. 
           The color is named after a duck. Specifically, a male duck. A drake is a male duck, 
           and many drakes have a dark blue color somewhere on their bodies. Those blue areas are what gave the color its name.

      <div>  
        <h2> Falu </h2>
        <h3> Hexcode: #801818 </h3><br>
          <p> The color Falu is another one of those rare colors with an interesting history. The mining city of Falun, 
            Sweden is the origin of the color's name. Falun was best-known for its copper mining industry. While the mines 
            closed almost 30 years ago, the city still celebrates its heritage. Notably, at the city mines' peak, they produced 
            over half the world's copper supply. <br><br>

            It's no surprise that the color Falu refers to a copper-like shade of red. Interestingly, 
            it's common not just in Sweden but in neighboring Norway and Finland as well. 
            That is because these countries use it in coloring barns, much like the iron red color seen in American barns.

    <div>  
      <h2>Labrador</h2>
      <h3> Hexcode: #FFFEF2</h3><br>
        <p>Labrador is yet another one of those rare colors that people can't agree on what it actually is. 
          While many sources claim it's a shade of blue, others suggest it might actually be brown or gray! 
          The confusion may come from its origin, a mineral called labradorite. 
          Labradorite can come in shades of gray or blue, and as its name suggests, comes from Labrador in Canada.
           While most labradorite stones have a bluish color, many also have shades of green. 
           It's a bit of a surprise that labrador doesn't refer to green too. In actual fact, the color is closer to cream.

  <div>  
    <h2>Mikado</h2>
    <h3> Hexcode: #FFC40C</h3><br>
      <p>Mikado is another one of those rare colors whose name actually refers to multiple hues.
        The color most commonly called mikado is a shade of yellow. However, shades of brown and orange with the same name also exist.
        <br><br>
        The name “mikado” means “honorable gate”, perhaps referring to the gates of imperial palaces. 
        East Asian nations considered yellow to be the color of royalty, and Japan was no exception.
        The color is similar to that of the chrysanthemum, the imperial flower of Japan.

  <div>  
    <h2>Zaffre </h2>
    <h3> Hexcode: #0014A8</h3><br>
      <p>And finally, we have arrived at the last color on our list. 
        Zaffre is one of those rare colors whose name may be unfamiliar, but which may sound vaguely familiar anyway. 
        It is a shade of blue which takes its name from the Italian word zaffira, which means sapphire. 
        Yes, it's supposed to represent the color of sapphires.<br><br>

        Despite the name, zaffre did not originate from sapphire. 
        In fact, zaffre was originally produced from cobalt. 
        Chemical processes involving cobalt compounds can create blue colors. 
        When this process was first discovered, it was a big deal because these blue colors did not fade easily.
        <br><br>
        Interestingly enough, while people associate sapphires with the color blue, 
        they can come in other colors as well. In fact, green sapphires are fairly common.
         Meanwhile, sapphires that come in other colors such as yellow and pink also exist.
